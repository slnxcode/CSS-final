This project is a design for a client portfolio website.
 - After the first design of the page layout, I realized that it's better to make the whole page a flexbox so as to adapt it to different screen sizes. Hence, I had to style the page all over again. Stressful but worth it!
 - I'm considering hosting this project to a live website for a client.
